        "So from that week on, there was a bit of thought running around the spacing differences between FC, RH, and MH; it was as if I was dancing around my original questions in these odd tangents. This happened for a few weeks, but it was a great learning lesson for me. There was a trip taken with Mong-Han, where I went and practiced using the guelph permeameter to the South of Rhonda's Hill. Just after that trip, I was so excited to be able to implement it with Mariel on my next trip up to the field; however, the idea was shot down by Bill - and for good reason. It didn't really make sense to use it over the summer while the ground was completely dry... We went out to do some rough <b>surveys</b> of the 2019 landslides, as well as collect soil samples. Our plan was to hammer down a small core to collect a known volume, but the ground was as hard as a rock, so I just collected clods of clay, which turned out to be a bit useless. \n",

        "This has become a common theme with most of the ideas that I have involving my project. It's frustrating because I really wish that I was able to have more to do and more to show for myself at the conference, but after many conversations with Mariel I'm realizing that I really don't <i>need</i> to produce such a significant amount. I'm going out to the field, I'm learning new tools, and I'm developing a story that I will publish in the spring - I'm doing enough.\n"

It was exciting! There is probably a geologic control on the landslides, which is great. I have the old geologic map to study, as well as the task of playing with rainfall data to try and make a case for increased rainfall at Rhonda's Hill versus everywhere else.
