    "Antelope Valley Ranch lies on the Great Valley Sequence which is composed of turbidite layers of sandstone, shales, conglomgerate, and interbedded sandstone-shale layers. Each of these lithologies produces different wavelengths of channel incision in the hills, as observed by LiDAR and aerial imaging. This region experienced two significant storms over the past three years; a larger one in 2017 caused over 400 landslides, and then another in 2019 caused over ### landslides, all in new regions. \n",
